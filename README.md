A collection of Python scripts developed for red teaming, penetration testing, and vulnerability exploitation. This repository aims to provide practical, hands-on tools for various phases of a security assessment, built with readability and extensibility in mind.

## Overview

This repository serves as my personal toolkit for red teaming and ethical hacking, leveraging the power and flexibility of Python. Each script is designed to automate specific tasks, from initial reconnaissance to exploitation, session management, and post-exploitation activities. The goal is to build robust, modular, and easy-to-understand tools that can be adapted to various scenarios encountered in real-world security engagements.

## Folder Structure

The tools are organized into logical categories to make navigation straightforward:

* `web_exploits/`: Contains scripts targeting web application vulnerabilities (e.g., RCE, SQLi, XSS).
* `recon_scripts/`: (Placeholder) Scripts for information gathering and reconnaissance.
* `post_exploitation/`: (Placeholder) Tools for maintaining access, privilege escalation, etc.

---

## Getting Started

To get started with these tools, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x**: All scripts are developed and tested with Python 3.
    * You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **`pip`**: Python's package installer.
* **`netcat`**: For catching reverse shells. (Usually pre-installed on Linux distributions like Kali/Parrot OS).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/RedTeam-Python-Tools.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/RedTeam-Python-Tools.git)
    cd RedTeam-Python-Tools
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate into the base directory of the cloned repository and install the required Python libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(**Note:** You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file. See the section below.)*

## Usage Examples

### `web_exploits/automated_rce_exploit.py`

This script automates the process of authenticating to a web application (via known credentials or brute-force) and then attempting Remote Code Execution (RCE) to either run commands interactively or initiate a reverse shell.

**Before Running:**

1.  **Configure `automated_rce_exploit.py`**: Open the script and modify the global configuration variables at the top:
    * `TARGET_LOGIN_URL`
    * `TARGET_RCE_URL`
    * `COMMAND_PARAM_NAME`
    * `ATTACKER_IP`
    * `ATTACKER_PORT`
    * `KNOWN_USERNAME`, `KNOWN_PASSWORD`
    * `WORDLIST_FILE_PATH`
    * `LOGIN_SUCCESS_INDICATOR`, `LOGIN_FAILURE_INDICATOR`
2.  **Prepare your wordlist**: Ensure the `passwords.txt` file (or whatever you specify in `WORDLIST_FILE_PATH`) exists in the same directory as the script, containing one password per line.
3.  **Set up your Netcat listener**: For reverse shell attempts, start a netcat listener on your attacker machine on the specified `ATTACKER_PORT`.
    ```bash
    nc -lvnp <ATTACKER_PORT>
    ```
    (e.g., `nc -lvnp 4444`)

**Running the script:**

```bash
python3 web_exploits/automated_rce_exploit.py
